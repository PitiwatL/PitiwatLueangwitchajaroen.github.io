The  transformation-based  methods  are  indeed  the  convenient  ways  for  constructing  a  newcopula using known copulas. In this research,  we characterize linear rational transformations for mul-tivariate copulas and multivariate quasi-copulas.  This is an extension to the already known results inthe bivariate case.  We found that this type of transformations extended naturally for the multivariatequasi-copulas.  Yet, the only linear rational transformation of multivariate copulas is the identity functionwhich is different from the bivariate case.  This means that the set of linear rational functions that trans-form a multivariate copula varies depending on the copula itself.  As an example, we also characterizesuch sets in the case of the trivariate product copula.
